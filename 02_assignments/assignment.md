# Assignment: The Secret Password

You are stuck in a virtual room and can only leave if you figure out the password! Fortunately, somebody left behind 6 clues for you to find the secret password, but the messaging is not that clear. It is your job to discover what the secret password is!

1. The very odd and inedible ingredient in a cake recipe

### No idea on how to automate this search, if do it manually this can be used:
### Go to the destination folder:    cd 02_assignments/clues/food/cake
### Open files one by one:   cat chocolate_cake.txt and find the odd and inedible ingredient
### OR
#### If exact file known and ingredient name in known this can search the string:      grep -r "Paper" 02_assignments/clues/food/cake
### OR
#### If exact file is unknown and ingredient name in known this can search the string: find . -type f -exec grep -H "Paper" {} +

2. The season number that contains only 18 episodes (Hint: How do you list them?)

### Go to the destination folder:    cd 02_assignments/clues/shows/friends
### Now we can loop through the folders and find the one that contains 18 files
### for season_folder in season_*; do
###    num_episodes=$(ls -1 "$season_folder" | wc -l)
###    if [ "$num_episodes" -eq 18 ]; then
###        season_number=$(echo "$season_folder" | sed 's/season_//')
###        echo "$season_number"
###    fi
